# Cicero

### A multi-function educational website to assist students, especially those that come from low-income families.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by services such as Sparknotes, which provides handy summaries that, in our experience, help us engage with texts. Even though we love Sparknotes, it does have its limitations. While it has many books, there are even more that it doesn't have, and that's not to mention the lack of articles or any other text forms.
## What it does
One of the functions of Cicero is it allows users to input text and returns a summary of it that contains the most crucial information. However, understanding the text isn't always enough, as mental health also plays a big role in how students learn. We have recognized this as a factor, and have subsequently added a chatbot feature, to check in and gauge how students are feeling
